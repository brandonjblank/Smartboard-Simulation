# Smarter Board

## About This Project
This project was created by Brandon Blank and Brandon Ho as the final project for the University of Winnipeg's ACS 3916 Human Computer Interaction class for the 2016 winter semester. We created this project for the purpose of showing off a user interface design that improved upon existing designs in an education and business environment with corresponding program functionality to illustrate the usefulness and ease of use of the design. 

Smarter Board was built in Java using the Java Server Faces framework, with Primefaces and JDBC API for increased functionality and database archival and retrival of data. JavaScript was used to create the canvas and slide navgation. 

## Features and Functionality
This project features a fully functional user interface with several functional components such as drawing on a canvas, navigating the canvas slides, and changing the program theme theme. The initial project was designed with the following features in-mind:

1) Create slides on-the-go and allow navigation between created and new slides.
2) Allow retroactive additions or changes to slide data.
3) Open an existing set of slides saved in a database.
4) Save slides to a database.
5) Choose between different themes (grey and blue).

## What's inside?
Included in this Github repository is the original project, and wire-frame mockups using Balsamiq. This project was originally a student project, so there are several components to it that are insufficient for external use and practical validation. The original project is meant to showcase design and creativity. 

## Future Plans
At this moment we do not plan on continuing development for this project, but if we get around to it we will be sure to update this page.
