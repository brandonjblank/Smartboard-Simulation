# Smartboard Simulation

This project was made for the University of Winnipeg's ACS 3916 Human Computer Interaction class by Brandon Blank and Brandon Ho. For this project, we came up with and implemented a simulation of a smart board design and user interface. The initial project was composed of several features:

1) The ability to create multiple slides, and send them to a database for permanent storage
2) The ability to switch between slides
3) The ability to choose between two different themes (grey and blue)
4) The ability to open an existing set of slides

The reasoning behind this project was to create a design that would benefit and improve upon existing designs in an education and business environment. 

Included in this Github repository are our original project, and wire-frame mockups using Balsamiq.
